package javalearning.myTraining.day2.exceptionHandling;

/**
 * In java, an exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
 * Exception handling allows us to gracefully handle errors and preventing unexpected crashes.
 *
 * There are three types of exceptions
 *  1. checked exceptions = checked exceptions are exception which are checked at compile time.
 *      a.  IOException = exception when an input or output operation fails, like reading from file(or) writing to a file.
 *      b.  SQLException = error occurs while accessing a database.
 *      c.  ParseException = error occurs while parsing string into another datatype.
 *      d.  classNotFoundException = occurs when a class with specified name cannot be found in the classpath
 *  2.  UncheckExceptions = Runtime exception, which usually occurs due to programming errors, such as logic errors (or) incorrect assumptions in the code.
 *      a.  NullPointerException = occur when trying to access or call a method where object reference is null.
 *      b.  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException = occur when we try to access an array element with an invalid index
 *      c. Arithmetic exception = occur when an arithmetic operation fails
 *      d.  IllegalArgumentException = indicates a argument passed for the method is in invalid format.
 * 3.   CustomExceptions = USer defined exceptions for specific business logic violations
 *
 * Example: Take as a Bank withdraw transaction. If amount is greater than balance.
 * The transaction cannot be completed, and it's an error.
 * so, at that moment, we have to handle the exception and inform the user that the account balance has insufficient funds
 * we can achieve the exceptions using try catch block
