/**
 * 	An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It contains abstract methods without a body.
 * 	When a class implements an interface, it will get access to methods and can override the methods according to business logic of the class.
 * 	Example: Payment Gateway is interface which provides services like processPayment and refundPayment.
 * 	different type of payment methods are classes which implements interface and uses those services
 * 	Why Use Interfaces?
 * 	Interfaces provide: Multiple Inheritance: Since Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance for classes,
 * 	interfaces allow a class to implement multiple behaviors.
